# CS345-Quality-Appraiser

In my story map, I found that the process of taking nature pictures mostly revolved around the end-goal of sharing these pictures with others. The interviewee who explicitly noted this said that, overall, the most difficult step was determining what pictures were “good enough” to keep and/or share.

I found this problem more interesting than that of organization or location mapping, plus I found an API that was perfectly suited for the solution. I plan to use the Everypixel API’s quality feature to show the user how aesthetically pleasing their picture is (via a numerical score from 0-100) based on technical aspects like lighting, contrast, noise, etc.

This project uses the free version of Everypixel API (https://www.everypixel.com/)
